# COVID_Variant_Tracker
US COVID Tracker



Use case #1: I want to be able to determine new case hotspots of coronavirus
Use case #2: I want a visual as well as text view of pertinent information
Use case #3: I want to be able to see the same level of granularity from the world down to municipalities
Use case #4: User viewing this tracker wants the ability to compare current status of COVID-19 to the point in 2020 where the majority of the world stayed at home. 
Use case #5: I want to view cases by variant of concern
Use case #6: I want to compare the growth by variant to the growth of the original virus
Use case #7: I want to know the current average positive test rate by municipality - do I want to know this over time?
Use case #8: I want to know the current fatality rate by municipality - do I want to know this over time?
Use case #9: 30 day forecast...cases or deaths?
Use case #10:


Average daily cases are the average number of new cases a day for the past seven days. This seven-day rolling average is calculated to smooth out fluctuations in daily case count reporting.
Average positive test rate is the percentage of coronavirus tests that are positive for the virus in the past seven days out of the total tests reported in that time period.
Fatality rate is the proportion of people who die of those who tested positive for COVID-19.
Total cases are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, including probable cases and cases confirmed by testing.
Uncertainty interval represents the possible range of estimates with 90% probability. In our forecasted hot spots views, the uncertainty interval is shown in parentheses, from the lower bound of the estimated forecast to the upper bound of the estimated forecast.
Data is updated daily. Data is compiled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Covid Act Now, Mayo Clinic patient data, Minnesota Department of Health, the Unacast Social Distancing Scoreboard, the United States Department of Health & Human Services, and USAFacts. We also use historical data from The COVID Tracking Project. The data shown here reflects known or documented cases. The actual number of infections is likely significantly higher.

It's not uncommon to see delays or gaps in the raw numbers reported. When lags occur in the COVID-19 data reported by counties and states, the Mayo Clinic data science team uses complex statistical modeling to estimate these values until final numbers are available.
